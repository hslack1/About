Hi there 👋🏻 I'm Holston.

Thanks for visiting my Github. I am a senior Data Analytics major, working on my senior research for this semester. Although my Github is pretty empty, I hope to upload more content as the semester goes on. 

I find value in doing meaningful work, data wrangling and entry, and learning new scripting languages. I have experience in Python, Tableau, SQL, R, and C++.
